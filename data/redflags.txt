[RF-01] Company identity gaps
- No company name, or a generic org (“Global Tech Ltd.”) with no footprint.
- No website, or a site created recently, thin content, broken pages, stock-only images.
- No verifiable address/LinkedIn/Glassdoor. Domain doesn’t match company (e.g., gmail/yahoo/proton).
- “Recruiter” email on a free domain or mismatched to company domain.

[RF-02] Vague or generic role content
- Title/description is boilerplate (“hard-working self-starter…”) with minimal specifics.
- Duties don’t match the title/seniority (e.g., “Senior Engineer” but tasks are data entry).
- Requirements contradict themselves (entry-level + “10 years experience”).
- Excessive buzzwords; little mention of team, tools, stakeholders, reporting lines.

[RF-03] Compensation & benefits inconsistencies
- Unrealistic pay ranges (“$90–$140/hr no experience required”).
- Vague or absent benefits; “get rich fast” framing; commissions only but marketed as salaried.
- Salary or benefits text copied verbatim across unrelated roles/companies.

[RF-04] Process anomalies
- Skips normal steps (no interview, “you’re hired today”).
- Asks to move off-platform immediately (WhatsApp/Telegram) for “screening.”
- Asks you to buy equipment, pay for training/certification, or front money for “onboarding.”
- “Check deposit” or reimbursements before employment is finalized.

[RF-05] Document & data requests
- Requests SSN, banking details, passport/ID scans pre-offer or outside secure HR portals.
- Demands remote desktop access, crypto wallets, or code-signing keys as part of “assessment.”

[RF-06] Urgency & pressure tactics
- “Act in the next 1 hour,” “limited slots,” “exclusive invite.”
- Threatening tone about losing opportunity if you ask questions.

[RF-07] Channel & domain signals
- Email domain newly registered; domain age hidden; DMARC/SPF/DKIM fail (if checkable).
- Misspellings in domain (typosquatting), e.g., microsofft-careers.com.
- Contact name doesn’t match signature, LinkedIn profile stock-looking or very new.

[RF-08] Logistics that don’t add up
- Fully remote global role but insists on being “local only,” or vice versa.
- Office address is a mailbox, coworking space with no suite; phone number is virtual-only.
- Time zone, currency, or legal entity inconsistencies across the post.

[RF-09] Odd attachments & links
- Links to public drives or URL shorteners for “HR forms.”
- PDFs/Docs asking for credentials or macro-enabled files.

[RF-10] Social proof inconsistencies
- Press claims that cannot be verified; awards with no sources.
- Employee count / funding claims conflict across profiles.

[RF-11] Posting metadata patterns
- Newly created employer account posting many unrelated roles simultaneously.
- Recycled descriptions across different companies; identical typos or formatting.

[RF-12] Language & style markers
- Over-capitalization, excessive emojis, or scammy phrasing (“guaranteed income,” “instant hire”).
- Poor grammar from “Fortune 500” brand; copy-paste artifacts (“lorem ipsum,” wrong locale).

GREEN FLAGS (help calibrate, not guarantees)
- Corporate domain email matching website; recruiters appear on LinkedIn with history.
- Clear hiring stages, realistic timeline, role-specific interviewers.
- Specific tech stack/tools, team context, reporting line, success metrics.
- Compensation aligned with market, benefits listed with standard specifics.
- Company info consistent across website, LinkedIn, job boards, and press.

QUICK SCORING RUBRIC (for rule-based baseline or RAG explanations)
- Assign 1 point per red flag triggered; weight severe items (RF-04, RF-05) as +2.
- 0–2 points → Likely Legit; 3–4 → Uncertain / Needs Verification; ≥5 or any +2 → Likely Fake.
- Always cite which RFs triggered and quote the snippet that triggered them.

RAG PROMPT HINT (use when generating an answer with local LLM)
“Given the job posting text and this checklist, identify triggered RF codes (RF-xx), quote the exact lines that triggered them, and output: 
- Verdict: Likely Fake / Possibly Real / Uncertain 
- Evidence: bullet list of RF codes with snippets 
- Next steps: 2–3 verification actions (domain check, LinkedIn cross-check, HR email)”
