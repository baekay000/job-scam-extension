new_set.csv is the new testing set that does not utilize the original fake job postings kaggle dataset, it is a mix of two separate datasets, as such I don't think it's the greatest but it seems to work ok

pare_post.csv may work better as the data is much more similar between the fake and real postings but either should work, I just figured I'd include both

model_test.py should run on the specified dataset and write the output to a .csv file
